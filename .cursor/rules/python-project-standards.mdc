# AlgoVerse Python Project Standards

## Environment & Structure

### Python Version & Dependencies
- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.12 for the virtual environment
- **Dependency Management**: Use `requirements.txt` (standard `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - Include `.env` support with a `.env.example` template
  - Actual `.env` will be excluded via `.gitignore`

### Folder Structure
Follow this structure (flexible but adhere to the insight):

```
project_root/
  .gitignore
  .env.example
  requirements.txt
  README.md
  src/
    __init__.py
    # core modules will live here
  explore/
    # exploratory scripts for PoC
  tests/
    __init__.py
  docs/     # light for now
```

**Key Folders:**
- `explore/` - Specifically for PoC/exploratory work, separate from core `src/`
- `src/` - Core modules for the final experiment
- `tests/` - Test suite (maintain even for PoC)
- `docs/` - Light documentation

**Future additions** (not required now): `experiments/`, `data/`, `logs/`

## Coding & Best Practices

### Style & Formatting
- Follow **PEP 8** naming and style conventions
- Use **black** (or similar) and **flake8** when convenient (tool setup can come later)
- Use **type hints** (mypy compatibility) where reasonable

### Documentation
- Write **doc-strings** and comments that clarify **why** a piece of code exists (especially in research/PoC context), not just what
- Use Python **logging** instead of raw `print()` for main flows

### Code Quality
- **Avoid magic numbers** and hard-coding of config values
- Use variables/constants or load from `.env`
- **Modularize code**: keep each function or module responsible for one clearly defined task

### Testing
- Write and maintain tests under `tests/` even for the PoC
- Baseline structure should be in place from the start

### Research Reproducibility
- Log key parameters
- Set random seeds when applicable
- Document files and configurations

## Workflow & Collaboration with Cursor

### Development Process
1. **Small chunks**: Each coding chunk will be small (e.g., "set up venv & requirements + initial folders")
2. **Review & approve**: Before generating code, review and approve the plan for that chunk (filenames, folder structure, dependencies)
3. **Test locally**: After the chunk is implemented, test locally; if fixes are needed, iterate before moving on
4. **Small commits**: All code is committed in small units with clear commit messages (e.g., "Initialize project scaffold for PoC")

### Communication
- Ask follow-up questions if anything is ambiguous
- These rules apply to both the PoC/explore work and the future full-experiment codebase
- Maintain a unified, maintainable foundation

## Summary
These standards ensure consistency, reproducibility, and maintainability throughout the project lifecycle, from exploratory PoC work to full experiments.
